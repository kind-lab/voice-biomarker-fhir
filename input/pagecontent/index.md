### Introduction

The Voice as a Biomarker of Health (VBH) profiles are based on [FHIR R4](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/index.html) and derived from [US Core STU5](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/STU5/) where possible. The profiles capture the data collected in the VBH study.


### What is Voice as a Biomarker of Health?
The National Institue of Health ([NIH](https://www.nih.gov/)) started the [Bridge2AI](https://commonfund.nih.gov/bridge2ai) initiative to fund the creation of foundational datasets in the medical field. Voice as a Biomarker of Health (VBH) is one of five foundational datasets being constructed currently. The VBH project will capture multimodal data from vocal recordings, genomic screens, waveform profiles, and electronic health records. The goal of the VBH project is to create a dataset that can be used to create applications to diagnose conditions based on voice recordings. The researchers creating the VBH dataset are multidisciplinary and across multiple institutions in Canada, USA, and France.

### Intended Audience
The VBH Profiles are meant for use in research and development. The audience then breaks into two categories:
1. Researchers: The final VBH dataset can be used to test and explore novel FHIR applications related to voice as a biomarker
2. Developers: The final VBH dataset can be used to test the robustness of applications to real-world data.
